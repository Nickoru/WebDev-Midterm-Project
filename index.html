                    Quiz experience that blends current events with
                    internet culture, designed to both challenge and
                    entertain.

                            This project started with a simple idea: we consume tons of content online, but how much of it actually sticks with us? From breaking headlines to hilarious memes, we are exposed to information every day but remembering it is a different story. We created this quiz to bring awareness to that habit. It's more than just guessing right or wrong; it's about realizing how much we absorb from the digital world, intentionally or not.
                        </p>

                            As students ourselves, we understand how traditional quizzes can feel boring or repetitive. That's why we focused on making this one lighthearted, modern, and relatable. It's built for anyone who wants a laugh while learning something new. From current news to viral tweets, we believe that knowledge comes in many forms. This quiz is perfect for group play, solo challenges, or just killing time while actually learning something in the process.

                            Scroll or Scholar? is not just a game it's a fresh take on learning in the digital age. We designed it to be entertaining, informative, and socially relevant. It's our way of turning mindless scrolling into a meaningful experience. Through this project, we hope to encourage people to stay curious, stay informed, and most importantly, enjoy the process. Because sometimes, the most unexpected places like your social media feed can teach you something valuable.
